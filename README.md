# Experiment 16
# Aim
To study and implement Exception Handling

# Apparatus 
VS code 

# Theory
An exception is an unexpected problem that arises during the execution of a program our program terminates suddenly with some errors/issues. Exception occurs during the running of the program (runtime).
1. try in C++
* The try keyword represents a block of code that may throw an exception placed inside the try block.
* Itâ€™s followed by one or more catch blocks. If an exception occurs, try block throws that exception.

2. catch in C++
* The catch statement represents a block of code that is executed when a particular exception is thrown from the try block.
* The code to handle the exception is written inside the catch block.

3. throw in C++
* An exception in C++ can be thrown using the throw keyword.
* When a program encounters a throw statement, then it immediately terminates the current function and starts finding a matching catch block to handle the thrown exception.

            ans = n1/n2;
            cout<<"answer = "<<ans<<endl;
        }
    }

    catch( float num)
    {
        cout<<"ERROR: division by "<<num<<endl;
